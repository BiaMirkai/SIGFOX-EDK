# Board Modifications

In this section, you'll find schematics of which components need to be present for certain configurations of the EDK to work.

<br>__For example__, by default the EDK Analog Input works with a 4-20mA current loop, allowing for a wide possibility of applications.
<br>If one wishes to use the DS18B20 (One-Wire) temperature sensor, a few resistors need to be changed.
