# uDEV Sigfox EDK Manual

This folder contains the full configuration manual for the EDK board.
It includes how to install every program needed to run your board, and how to configure each step.

We recommend downloading the manual and reading it with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, as opposed to reading it directly here at GitHub.

If any questions arise, please [contact us](mailto:contato@udev.com.br).
