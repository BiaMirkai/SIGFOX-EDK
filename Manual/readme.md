# uDEV Sigfox EDK Manual

This folder contains the full configuration manual for the EDK board.
It includes how to install every program needed to run your board, and how to configure each step.

Especially important is the procedure to install the __SAM D21__ processor files to your Atmel installation.
<br>This is done using the __Device Pack Manager__, and is described at length in the manual. Please follow it thoroughly.

We recommend downloading the manual and reading it with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, as opposed to reading it directly here at GitHub.

If any questions arise, please [contact us](mailto:contato@udev.com.br).
