# How to install:

* Download the <b>board-files.zip</b> file, and extract its contents somewhere.
* The newly extracted <b>board-files</b> folder will contain two items:
  * A file named <b>boards.tcl</b>
  * A folder named <b>uDEV-EDK</b>
* Copy or cut both the file and the folder.
* Paste them in the <b>tcl_lib</b> directory, under your SAM-BA installation folder.
* <b>ATTENTION:</b> There will be a warning about overwriting the <i>boards.tcl</i> file - be sure to <b>overwrite</b> it, or the EDK will not be recognized.
